# git-java-pingpongpi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jadekler/git-java-pingpongpi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jadekler/git-java-pingpongpi)

A RESTful API that takes POST requests to `/activity` and gives Activity data when you GET `/activity`. This is intended for use with a Raspberry Pi (github repo link coming, once it's built) that sends activity information from a PIR (infrared motion sensor).

In short, the storage container for a Raspberry Pi's information about whether the ping pong table is available.
